## Project Overview
This project provides a machine learning-based predictive model that analyzes the impact of various fertilizers on crop growth. It helps farmers and agricultural scientists make data-driven decisions to improve crop yield and optimize fertilizer usage.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecast the effects of fertilizers on crop yield.
- **Yield Improvement**: Suggest optimal combinations of fertilizers to maximize output.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Analyze and minimize fertilizer usage while maintaining crop health.
- **Data Insights**: Provide actionable insights using historical data.
- **Crop Health Monitoring**: Track the effects of fertilizers on crop quality over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
  - NumPy (Numerical computations)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning algorithms)
- **Tools**:
  - Cloud Storage (for data storage)
  - PC (for local development)
